40910569,A New Fragment-Based Pharmacophore Virtual Screening Workflow Identifies Potent Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 Helicase.,Doijen J; Xie J; Marsili S; Bains T; Mann MK; Abeywickrema P; Van den Broeck N; Permann C; Langer T; Ibis G; Mattelaer CA; Harvey J; van Raalte S; Fino R; Pande V; Peeters D; Patrick A; Van Damme E; van Vlijmen H; Van Loock M; Jacoby E,Journal of computational chemistry,2025 Sep 5,"Herein we report the in silico discovery of 13 novel micromolar potent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase validated in cellular antiviral and biophysical ThermoFluor assays. The compounds, discovered using a novel fragment-based pharmacophore virtual screening workflow named FragmentScout, enable the advancement of novel antiviral agents. FragmentScout uses publicly accessible structural data of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase, which was previously generated at the Diamond LightSource by XChem high-throughput crystallographic fragment screening. The workflow generates a joint pharmacophore query for each binding site, thereby aggregating the pharmacophore feature information present in each experimental fragment pose. The joint pharmacophore query is then used to search 3D conformational databases using the Inte:ligand LigandScout XT software. The FragmentScout in silico workflow offers a novel tool for identifying micromolar hits from millimolar fragments in fragment-based lead discovery. It is anticipated that this workflow will enhance systematic data mining of the growing collection of XChem datasets."

However, conventional drug discovery approaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding. METHODS: Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), molecular docking, and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling have been examined for their role in the identification and optimization of microbial metabolites. RESULTS: AI-driven approaches have significantly enhanced compound screening and prediction of therapeutic efficacy. Nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems have improved the bioavailability, specificity, and stability of microbial metabolites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in clinical translation due to the lack of in vivo validation and comprehensive pharmacokinetic data. DISCUSSION: This review highlights the integration of advanced computational tools and nanotechnology in accelerating the discovery and delivery of microbial-derived anticancer agents. CONCLUSION: Future directions should focus on integrating AI with synthetic biology to engineer microbial strains capable of producing enhanced bioactive compounds. Additionally, leveraging nanotechnology could refine targeted delivery mechanisms. A deeper understanding of molecular pathways and drug resistance mechanisms is essential to support the development of combination therapies. Overall, microbialderived compounds hold substantial potential in advancing precision oncology."
40903703,A Comparative Review of the Pharmacology of Dalbavancin and Oritavancin for Gram-Positive Infections: Birds of a Feather or Apples and Oranges?,Hussein M; Barclay J; Baker M; Wu Y; Thombare VJ; Patil N; Murthy AB; Sharma R; Rao GG; Blaskovich MAT; Li J; Velkov T,Infectious diseases and therapy,2025 Sep 3,"The clinical landscape of Gram-positive infections has been reshaped with the introduction of long-acting lipoglycopeptides, particularly dalbavancin and oritavancin. Both agents share broad-spectrum activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant strains, yet differ markedly in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, resistance profiles, and clinical adoption. This review presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of their structural innovations, distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, and dual mechanisms of action, supported by minimum inhibitory concentration data across key pathogens. Despite belonging to the same antimicrobial class, these agents exhibit important differences in real-world applications and clinical integration. We highlight real-world evidence supporting off-label use in osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and bloodstream infections, where traditional therapies fall short. Furthermore, we explore resistance development, drug-drug interaction profiles, and outpatient utility, providing actionable insights for optimizing treatment strategies. These findings underscore the need for tailored clinical integration of dalbavancin and oritavancin and spotlight their potential roles in future antimicrobial stewardship frameworks."
40903666,Targeting the TRIB3-MYC axis in cancer: mechanistic insights and therapeutic disruption strategies.,Kamel EM; Alsalamah SA; Allam AA; Ahmed NA; Alkhayl FFA; Lamsabhi AM,Investigational new drugs,2025 Sep 4,"The oncogenic transcription factor MYC drives proliferation, metabolism, and therapy resistance in the majority of human cancers, yet its large, nuclear protein-protein interface has long frustrated direct drug discovery. A pivotal breakthrough was the identification of Tribbles pseudokinase 3 (TRIB3) as a high-affinity scaffold that binds the helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper region of MYC, blocks the E3-ubiquitin-ligase, UBE3B, from tagging critical lysines, and thereby prolongs MYC protein half-life while enhancing MYC-MAX transcriptional output. This review integrates structural, biochemical, and in vivo data to show how genetic deletion or pharmacological eviction of TRIB3 collapses MYC levels, silences its gene program, and suppresses tumor growth in B-cell lymphomas and selected solid tumors. We detail two distinct solid-tumor circuits: (i) inducible TRIB3 overload in KRAS- or EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma that triggers lethal paraptosis when mTOR is inhibited by everolimus plus ginsenoside Rh2; (ii) VHL-controlled UBE3B abundance in breast carcinoma, where loss of VHL renders tumors dependent on TRIB3 shielding for sustained MYC signaling. Emerging therapeutics include helix-mimetic and stapled peptides such as PCM4, fragment-derived small molecules that target a unique Glu344-centered pocket on TRIB3, and PROTAC degraders that either eliminate TRIB3 or hijack it to destroy MYC. When combined with DNA-damaging agents, BET or CDK7 inhibitors, or ligase-restoring strategies, these disruptors produce marked synergy in preclinical models. Remaining translational challenges-efficient intracellular delivery, biomarker-guided patient selection, and off-target surveillance-are increasingly tractable thanks to advances in peptide formulation, AI-accelerated screening, and established regulatory paths for targeted degraders. Collectively, current evidence positions the TRIB3-MYC interface as a druggable Achilles' heel and a realistic gateway to long-sought direct MYC blockade in the clinic."
40899411,Discovery of Furopyrimidine-Pyrazole Hybrid Compounds Targeting p53-MDM2 Interaction as Anticancer Agents.,Mansour MA; Hassan GS; Jaballah MY; Serya RAT; Dege N; Sahin O; Sharaky M; Zhang X; Su R; Kong D; Abouzid KAM,Archiv der Pharmazie,2025 Sep,"Inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction restores the function of the tumour suppressor protein, p53, and offers a promising avenue for anticancer therapies. Herein, a novel series of pyrazoline-derived compounds was developed and synthesised to serve as potential inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction. Scaffold hopping was adopted via replacing the cis-imidazoline core of Nutlin-2 with a pyrazoline core, and molecular docking confirmed the binding orientation of the designed compounds at the p53-MDM2 interaction site. The antiproliferative activities of these compounds were evaluated against the NCI60 cell lines, where compounds 6c, 6d and 9d displayed the highest inhibitory activities. Subsequently, compound 6d was selected for the five-doses NCI60 cell panel assay to afford a mean GI(50) value of 8.39 muM. Moreover, 6d significantly reduced MDM2 expression and elevated the expression of p53 in an ELISA-based assay, yielding a biochemical IC(50) value of 13.8 muM against MDM2, which was confirmed by Western blot as well. Cytotoxicity study confirmed the selectivity of 6d towards cancerous cell lines over normal cell lines. Additionally, X-ray crystallography was used to check the stereochemistry of compound 6d. These newly identified MDM2 inhibitors represent promising candidates for the development of novel targeted anticancer agents."
