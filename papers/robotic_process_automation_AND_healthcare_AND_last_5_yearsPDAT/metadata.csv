40053771,Applying Robotic Process Automation to Monitor Business Processes in Hospital Information Systems: Mixed Method Approach.,Park A; Jung SY; Yune I; Lee HY,JMIR medical informatics,2025 Mar 7,"BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMRs) have undergone significant changes due to advancements in technology, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cloud services. The increasing complexity within health care systems necessitates enhanced process reengineering and system monitoring approaches. Robotic process automation (RPA) provides a user-centric approach to monitoring system complexity by mimicking end user interactions, thus presenting potential improvements in system performance and monitoring. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the application of RPA in monitoring the complexities of EMR systems within a hospital environment, focusing on RPA's ability to perform end-to-end performance monitoring that closely reflects real-time user experiences. METHODS: The research was conducted at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital using a mixed methods approach. It included the iterative development and integration of RPA bots programmed to simulate and monitor typical user interactions with the hospital's EMR system. Quantitative data from RPA process outputs and qualitative insights from interviews with system engineers and managers were used to evaluate the effectiveness of RPA in system monitoring. RESULTS: RPA bots effectively identified and reported system inefficiencies and failures, providing a bridge between end user experiences and engineering assessments. The bots were particularly useful in detecting delays and errors immediately following system updates or interactions with external services. Over 3 years, RPA monitoring highlighted discrepancies between user-reported experiences and traditional engineering metrics, with the bots frequently identifying critical system issues that were not evident from standard component-level monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: RPA enhances system monitoring by providing insights that reflect true end user experiences, which are often overlooked by traditional monitoring methods. The study confirms the potential of RPA to act as a comprehensive monitoring tool within complex health care systems, suggesting that RPA can significantly contribute to the maintenance and improvement of EMR systems by providing a more accurate and timely reflection of system performance and user satisfaction."

38918486,A case study of lean digital transformation through robotic process automation in healthcare.,Huang WL; Liao SL; Huang HL; Su YX; Jerng JS; Lu CY; Ho WS; Xu JR,Scientific reports,2024 Jun 25,"Under Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) system, it's crucial for all healthcare providers to accurately submit medical expense claims to the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) to avoid incorrect deductions. With changes in healthcare policies and adjustments in hospital management strategies, the complexity of claiming rules has resulted in hospitals expending significant manpower and time on the medical expense claims process. Therefore, this study utilizes the Lean Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) management approach to identify wasteful and non-value-added steps in the process. Simultaneously, it introduces Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools to replace manual operations. After implementation, the study effectively reduces the process time by 380 min and enhances Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE) from 69.07 to 95.54%. This research validates a real-world case of Lean digital transformation in healthcare institutions. It enables human resources to be allocated to more valuable and creative tasks while assisting hospitals in providing more comprehensive and patient-centric services."
37223884,Deploying Bots in Healthcare to Find Revenue Cycle Improvements.,Dunn RT,Frontiers of health services management,2023 Summer 01,"Doing more with less has been a business mantra for decades. Healthcare leaders have implemented flex scheduling and job sharing, streamlined workflows, committed to process improvement techniques such as Lean, hired retirees, gained efficiencies from remote work ... and the list goes on. Each tactic has yielded productivity improvements, yet the need to do more with less continues. Postpandemic challenges include staff recruitment and retention, labor inflation, and dwindling margins, all of which must be addressed while maintaining corporate cultures. The journey with bots described here started in this dynamic environment, and the work has not been single-threaded. The organization featured here-an integrated delivery network-has digital front-door and back-end robotic process automation (RPA) projects underway. The digital front-door initiative supports patient self-registration and automates authorizations and insurance verification processes. The back-end patient financial services RPA project replaces and enhances existing technology. Revenue cycle as a multidepartment function is leadership's poster child for RPA, and the revenue cycle team is tasked to demonstrate the value of the technology. This article covers the initial steps and lessons learned in the process."
